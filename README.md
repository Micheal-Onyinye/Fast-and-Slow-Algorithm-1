## Detect Cycle in Linked List – Fast & Slow Pointer

    This is my first try solving the Linked List Cycle problem using the fast and slow pointer method (also called tortoise 🐢 and hare 🐇).
    
    Idea: Move one pointer 1 step and the other 2 steps. If they ever meet, there’s a cycle.
    
    Language: Python
    
    Tested: Works both when there’s a cycle and when there’s none.
